# PerfChecker
PerfChecker is a monitoring tool for OpenStack that aims at detecting and diagnosing performance bottlenecks in NFV scenarios. For this, we identified the appropriate SDP types for deploying Cloud-based NFV scenarios, conducted a performance evaluation to compare them, and took the best to direct the monitoring target.
